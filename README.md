# Go table tests in Bash

Go table tests are an effective means of DRYing up test code.  This library supports tests
in Bash that optionally run subtests.

This readme is an open to-do item.  See
https://github.com/binaryphile/task.bash/blob/main/task_test.bash for a commented, working
example at the moment.
